# Minecraft Server Download/Software API

## MC-SRV-DL-API Lets you easily download minecraft server software such as paper, purpur or vanilla all in one place.

### It can be used to always get the latest server software or as a replacement for the now archived Yive's mirror.

The Minecraft Server Software API let's you download server softwares with ease. As of right now, these are:

- ðŸ“œPaper
- ðŸŽ¶Purpur
- ðŸŽ‰Vanilla

Some of the other server softwares that are planned to be added:

To download one, use the /download endpoint with the software, version and build. Here are some examples:

To grab the latest paper .jar download:

`
GET https://mc-srv-dl-api.pingwinco.xyz/download/latest/latest
`

This will redirect you to the .jar file.

To grab the latest vanilla server.jar download link: (no build parameter required)

`
GET https://mc-srv-dl-api.pingwinco.xyz/download/vanilla/latest?json=true
`

Example response:

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "download": "https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/84194a2f286ef7c14ed7ce0090dba59902951553/server.jar"
}
```

## âš  WARNING! When using "latest" as the version parameter, it may throw an error as the server software providers have not yet updated to the latest version. âš
