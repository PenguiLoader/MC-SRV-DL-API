# Minecraft Server Download/Software API

## MC-SRV-DL-API Lets you easily download minecraft server software such as paper, purpur or vanilla all in one place.

### It can be used to always get the latest server software or as a replacement for the now archived Yive's mirror.

The Minecraft Server Software API let's you download server softwares with ease. As of right now, these are:

- ðŸ“œPaper

To download one, use the /download endpoint with the software, version and build parameter. Here is an example:

}
```

To grab the latest vanilla server.jar: (no build parameter required)
