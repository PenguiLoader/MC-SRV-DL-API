# Minecraft Server Download/Software API

## MC-SRV-DL-API Lets you easily download minecraft server software such as paper, purpur or vanilla all in one place.

### It can be used to always get the latest server software or as a replacement for the now archived Yive's mirror.

The Minecraft Server Software API let's you download server softwares with ease. As of right now, these are:

- ðŸ“œPaper
- ðŸŽ¶Purpur
- ðŸŽ‰Vanilla

Some of the other server softwares that are planned to be added:

- ðŸŒŸGlowstone

To download one, use the /download endpoint with the software, version and build parameter. Here is an example:

To grab the latest paper .jar download link:

`
GET https://mc-srv-dl-api.pingwinco.xyz/download?software=paper&version=latest&build=latest
`

Example response:

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "download": "https://api.papermc.io/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.20.1/builds/41/downloads/paper-1.20.1-41.jar"
}
```

To grab the latest vanilla server.jar: (no build parameter required)

`
GET https://mc-srv-dl-api.pingwinco.xyz/download?software=vanilla&version=latest
`

Example response:

```json
{
  "error": false,

}
```

## âš  WARNING! When using "latest" as the version parameter, it may throw an error as the server software providers have not yet updated to the latest version. âš
